# LieblingsIntervalCalc
Garmin watch App to calculate the 200 &amp; 400m (and configurable others) split times for a given Pace. For Runners and Nerds

And for my RunSquad Dortmund fellows

App will require input of the desired Pace (mi:sec format)
App will require input of the desired Lieblings-Interval length (in meters, that is in metric system, the one used outside the Commonwealth ;) )
App will display a simple table showing the required split times for 200m (half stadium) and 400m (full stadium)

Later release of a Datafield integrated in Watch Activities such as Run / Track-Run might be coming - or not - or maybe... 
Datafield showing the next target-split might be handy or not, not sure, need input :)
