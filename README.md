# LieblingsIntervalCalc
Garmin watch App to calculate the 200 &amp; 400m (and configurable others) split times for a given Pace. For Runners and Nerds

And for my RunSquad Dortmund fellows

<li>App will require input of the desired Pace (mi:sec format)</li>
<li>App will require input of the desired Lieblings-Interval length (in meters, that is in metric system, the one used outside the Commonwealth ;) ) </li>
<li>App will display a simple table showing the required split times for 200m (half stadium) and 400m (full stadium)</li>
<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
input Pace/km: 4:20min<br>
input <3-Interval: 800m<br>
<br>
Defaults for inputs are the last used values<br>
<br>
<b>Result:</b><br>
200m Split: 0:52min<br>
400m Split: 1:44min<br>
<3-Interval: 3:28min

Later release of a Datafield integrated in Watch Activities such as Run / Track-Run might be coming - or not - or maybe... 
Datafield showing the next target-split might be handy or not, not sure, need input :)
